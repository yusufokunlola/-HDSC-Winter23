The number of unique values for each feature was assessed.\n5. Missing values in the dataset was checked.\n6. The summary statistics was obtained.\n\n\n### Observation\n1. The dataset consists of 2000 rows and 8 columns.\n2. The dataset consists of float64(1), int64(3) and object(4) datatypes respectively.\n3. The unique variables in the 'linked_cases' and 'cause' fields were assessed.\n    - the linked_cases column contained missing values and the the  uniques values were in sentence case (True, False).\n    - the cause column had 5 unique values ('unknown', 'meat', 'vegetable', ' Meat', 'VEGETABLES') were instead of 3 unique features ( 'vegetable',  'meat', or 'unknown') as provided by the data dictionary. This could be due to inconsistent data entry.\n4. Missing values in the 'amount_paid' and 'linked_cases' fields were 1.8% and 1.3% respectively.\n5. The 'claim_amount' was found to be an object instead of floating number due to the Brazilian currency symbol ('R$').\n\n\n### Data Cleaning\n1. The non-numeric characters ('R$') in 'claim_amount' was removed  to convert the feature to float.\n2. Missing values in the 'amount_paid' field was replaced with the overall median amount paid as required.\n3. There were 4 unique locations as provided in the data dictionary, no cleaning required.\n4. Missing values in the 'linked_cases' field was replaced with 'FALSE' as required and the values in sentence case were converted to uppercase.\n5. Some entries have cause formatted as ' Meat' or 'VEGETABLES' were replaced with the value 'meat' or 'vegetable' respectively.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains 2000 rows and 8 columns without missing values.
